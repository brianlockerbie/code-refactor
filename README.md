SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
